Option A  

Hyginus 36.1: The use of the verb *priuaret* does a lot to help Hyginus get his point across. Instead of saying that Iole would tempt Hercules into infidelity, he elects to say something along the lines of Iole would "rob" Deianira of her marriage. The diction of this sentence implies that Deianara would blame Iole if Hercules cheated, instead of Hercules himself. 

Hyginus 36.3: Here, Hyginus uses the word *uiscera* in his description of what happened when Hercules tried to take the poisoned garmet off. This is a very descriptive and graphic word meaning "organs" or "entrails." Of all the possible ways to articulate this part of Hercules's death, Hyginus elects to use a quite brutal choice of words in order to depict the true gruesomeness of this event, highlighted best by *uiscera*.
