1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
antecedent = flumen - neuter singular - dative - it is dative because it tells the reader that the name Evenus belongs to the river

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
tranisre is a present active infinitve - I put it in the independent clause because it made sense within the context of the sentence & story.  

3. sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.
feminine, accusative, singular, indicative, active - from suffero - urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n46406 

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?  
sagittis is ablative and plural - describes the means in which he pierced  

5. Identify the form of moriens.  
moriens is a masculine, nominitive, singular, indicative, present active  participle.  

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?  
felle is a noun in the ablative singular. He uses this case to express that the arrows were dipped *in* the poison    

7. Identify the form of tinctas.  
tinctas is a feminine, accusative, plural, active, indicative  

8. Identify the form of exceptum.  
exceptum is an accusative neuter singular indicative active participle.

9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.  
moriens  

C  

Deianira, wife of Hercules, was not able to traverse the large river, which was named Evenus, 

asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, to help. 

He lifted Deianira up in the very same river with the intent to violate her. 

Because of this, Hercules went to this place and intervened, and Deianira begged his trust with tears, and he pierced Nessus with arrows.

As he was dying, because he knew the arrows had been dipped in the poison of the Lernaean Hydra and held great potentcy, he let out some of his blood, and he gave his blood to Deianira ❌ **Where's the idea of *exceptum* ?** and he told her it was a love potion.
