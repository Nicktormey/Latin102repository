Nessum sagittis confixit.

sanguinem suum exceptum Deianirae dedit
et id philtrum esse dixit.

Deianira, wife of Hercules, was not able to traverse the large river, which was named Evenus, and the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, asked to help. He lifted Deianira up in the very same river with the intent to violate her. Because of this, Hercules went to this place and intervened, and Deianira begged his trust with tears, and he pierced Nessus with arrows.

Because he knew he was dying, he dipped arrows in the poison of the Lernaean Hydra so that they hold great potentcy. He gave his blood to Deianira and he told her it was a love potion.
